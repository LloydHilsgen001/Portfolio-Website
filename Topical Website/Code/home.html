			<p>One ton of thorium produces as much energy as 200 tons of Uranium, and 3,500,000 tons of coal.</p>
			<p>A thorium reactor's plutonium production rate would be less than 2 percent of that of a standard reactor</p><p>and the plutonium's isotopic content would make it unsuitable for a nuclear detonation.</p>

			<p>Thorium is one of the most common actinides, and is often found along side rare earth metals like gold and neodymium.</p>
			<p>The current reserves of thorium in the US alone could power it for the next 1,000 years without any carbon emissions.</p>
			<p>Current Thorium reserves could produce 15x the amount of energy that our coal, natural gas, and oil reserves combined will produce.</p>
			<p>Because thorium reactors are practically meltdown proof, scaling energy needs can be met by them without risk of ecological damage</p>

			<p>Liquid fluoride thorium reactors are designed to be meltdown proof. A plug at the bottom of the reactor melts</p>
